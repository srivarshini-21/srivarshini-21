# Hello, I'm Srivarshini! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about creating innovative web applications that make life easier. Here's a bit about me and my work:

## ðŸŒŸ Projects

### Smart Recipe Planner

This project is a web application that helps users find recipes based on their available ingredients and dietary preferences. It also allows users to create an account, log in, and save their favorite recipes.
- **Check out the https://github.com/srivarshini-21/Smart-Recipe-Planner for more details.**

### Login Page

The login page allows users to authenticate by entering a username and password. It utilizes mock credentials to demonstrate the basic functionality of a login system using JavaScript. Users input their details, and the JavaScript checks if the entered credentials match the predefined mock username and password. If the credentials are correct, the user is granted access; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
